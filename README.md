# lofi-pomodoro

A simple, relaxing CLI Pomodoro timer that plays lo-fi beats during work sessions to help you stay focused and calm.

## Features

* **CLI Progress Bar**: Live countdown and progress bar using [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).
* **Lo-fi Audio Playback**: Randomly plays tracks from your specified folder using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).
* **Default Playlist**: If no `--music-folder` is provided, a built-in playlist of open-license lo-fi tracks will be used from the repository.
* **Configurable Durations**: Customize work, short break, and long break lengths.
* **Cycle Support**: Set the number of work/break cycles before a long break.
* **Simple Alerts**: Terminal beep and messages when switching phases.
* **Break Sounds**: Different ambient sounds during work and break periods.
* **Session Resume**: Resume a session from where you left off using the `--resume` option.
* **Audio Control**: Adjust volume and toggle work music/break sounds independently.
* **Music Controls**: Press 's' to skip, 'p' to pause/unpause, or 'i' to ignore a song during work sessions.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WittmannF/lofi-pomodoro.git
cd lofi-pomodoro
pip install -e .
```

## Getting Started

### Downloading Free Music

The project includes a script to download free lo-fi music from [Chosic](https://www.chosic.com). You can use it to build your own playlist.

**Note:** The scrape script requires additional dependencies. Install them with:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

Then you can use the script:

```bash
# Download lo-fi tracks (default style)
python scripts/scrape_songs.py
```

The script will:
- Download MP3 files from Chosic's free music library
- Save them to `chosic/{style}/` by default (e.g., `chosic/lofi/`)
- Remember what it has already downloaded (so you can re-run it safely)
- Use respectful crawling with delays between requests

**Note:** You can also use any folder containing `.mp3`, `.wav`, or `.ogg` files as your music source. Simply point the timer to your folder using the `--music-folder` option.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the timer with your music folder:

```bash
lofi-pomodoro --music-folder /path/to/your/music
```

Or use the default playlist (if available in `pomodoro/default-playlist/`):

```bash
lofi-pomodoro
```

Example with custom settings:

```bash
lofi-pomodoro \
  --music-folder ./music \
  --work 50 \
  --short 10 \
  --long 20 \
  --cycles 3 \
  --volume 0.7
```

Resume a session with remaining time:

```bash
lofi-pomodoro --resume 15  # Resume with 15 minutes remaining in first work cycle
```

Run without music or break sounds:

```bash
lofi-pomodoro --no-work-music --no-break-sound  # Run silently
```

### Music Controls

During work sessions, you can control the music playback:
- Press `s` to skip to the next track
- Press `p` to pause/unpause the timer and music
- Press `i` to ignore the current song (adds it to `.ignored_songs` file)
- The current track name is displayed when it starts playing
- Tracks won't repeat until all tracks have been played
